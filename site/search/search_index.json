To back up AIX or Linux workloads in PowerVS workspace in cloud, the BaaS VPC and the Power Virtual Server workspaces are required to be present in the same region and connected by using the local Transit Gateway. Compass automation creates these connections when the Compass service is created from the IBM Cloud Catalog. 2.  Data are backed up to the Compass backup vault servers in two separate regions for added resiliency. 3.  Multiple LPARs in PowerVS workspace can use the same secure backup servers. For LPARs in the second backup server site, VPE may need to be created.</p> <p>Today I am going to show you on how to achieve outcome #1</p>"},{"location":"#demo-steps","title":"Demo steps","text":"<p>Here are steps I follow in the demo today and happy dive deep into any area you like to spend time on:</p> <ol> <li>Leverage IBM Cloud Deployable Architectures to speed provisioning of PowerVS instances, networking and other cloud service needed to support the migration</li> <li>Provision Cobalt Iron Compass Backup-as-a-Service on IBM Cloud</li> <li>Perform backup of critical files and MySQL database to show an example</li> <li>Restore choice of files from the backup version</li> <li>Restore MySQL database</li> </ol> <p>For the purpose of this demo, I have pre-provisioned all cloud services and Compass to build the demo environment and I am going to show you what I pre-provisioned before I dive into how I backup and restore PowerVS using Cobalt Iron Compass.</p> <p>NOTE: Please refer to APPENDIX for detailed steps to build the demo environment. </p> <p>Leverage PowerVS Deployable Architecture</p> <p>IBM Cloud deployable architecture is cloud automation for deploying a common architectural pattern that combines one or more cloud resources. It offers a modular, flexible foundation for businesses to build, deploy, and manage applications securely in the cloud. IBM Cloud offers a few different flavors of deployable architectures that provide an automated deployment method to create an isolated Power Virtual Server workspace and connect it with IBM Cloud services and public internet. </p> <p>In this demo, we will create a simple quick start environment for quick testing. For more information on the various Power Virtual Server deployable architectures, refer to Power Systems Virtual Server with VPC landing zone documentation page.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Login to IBM Cloud and go to Cloud Catalog</p> </li> <li> <p>Search for \u2018Power Virtual Server with VPC landing zone\u2019 in the Catalog. </p> </li> <li> <p>PowerVS deployable architecture offers two variations Standard and QuickStart. Standard allows you to create the workspace and all relevant Networking that enables you to create as many PowerVS instances needed and also extend the architecture in future. QuickStart variations deploys the architecture and also provisions one PowerVS instance for you to experience end to end provisioning  flow. </p> </li> <li> <p>Use PowerVS Quickstart deployable architecture (DA) to create a new architecture. You can set up PowerVS instance with AIX, IBM i, Linux, or SAP. In this demo, we will set up a new architecture with RHEL 9.2 on PowerVS instance. Detailed instructions can be found in IBM Cloud docs.</p> </li> <li> <p>As you can see from the deployable architecture diagram, it creates Edge VPC and PowerVS workspace. In Edge VPC, it creates Bastion host (jump server) in management security group, and proxy server in network service security group. It also creates a PowerVS instance in the PowerVS workspace with RHEL 9.2. Other necessary components to connect PowerVS workspace with IBM Cloud resources and secure the environment are also created, for example, Transit Gateway, VPN, VPE, etc.</p> </li> </ol> <p></p> <ol> <li> <p>Click on Permissions and Security and Compliance tabs and explain those two tabs. </p> </li> <li> <p>Add to an existing project.  </p> </li> <li> <p>Let\u2019s create a Linux virtual server with RHEL 9.2 image.

By creating secure, encrypted backups, businesses can safely migrate workloads, test cloud environments, and ensure data redundancy across hybrid and multi-cloud setups. Secure backups provide a reliable foundation for scaling operations to the cloud, as they allow data to be restored or replicated in different cloud regions or providers, ensuring resilience and flexibility. This approach not only safeguards against data loss but also facilitates cloud adoption, enabling seamless data mobility, regulatory compliance, and risk management as companies expand their cloud infrastructure.</p> <p>As highlighted in the following figure, the backup images can be used to restore an environment in cloud. As discussed in section 3.1.2, as enterprises start to embrace cloud strategy, they can rapidly provision a dev/test environment in cloud when needed to take advantage of cloud without impacting critical production systems. This would also bring cost advantages to provision the environment with the right sizing only when needed. </p> <p>In this demo, you can use the PowerVS DA to provision a new environment or manually create a PowerVS instance as the restore environment. </p> <p>If you provision a new environment, make sure to add the backup VPC to the transit gateway to make sure that it has connectivity to the Compass vaults. Click on the Hamburg menu on the upper left, and find Transit Gateway. Click on the transit gateway of the restore environment, and add compass VPC if it is not there.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>We can login to the PowerVS instance to start the restore. The assumption is that provisioning tool will set up the environment and install necessary softwares, and Compass will backup and restore client data.</p> <p>In my demo, I run the following command to install and start the MySQL server. \uf0d8   dnf install mysql-server \uf0d8   systemctl start mysqld.service</p> <p>If your new system has the same hostname as before, you can go to the Commander dashboard, and make sure to enable the client installation. </p> <p>If your new system has different hostname from before, you need to go to the Commander dashboard and register the new system. The enable client installation should be enabled when you just register the system. </p> <p>Run the installer on the server. \uf0d8   ./ci_agent_cid01744_rhelp-4.5.0-343.sh install</p> <p>Now let\u2019s restore the data in my user directory /root/yytest.</p> <p>If the hostname of the recover server is different from before, you need to tell it to pick up the backup data from the previous server. You can update the configuration file for the Storage Protect. - cd /opt/tivoli/tsm/client/ba/bin/ - add to the end of the file dsm.sys ASNODENAME                 For example,       ASNODENAME           cid01744-pi-qs-fil-00 <ul> <li> <p>You can also run dsmc command with parameter to run as a different node for the current session, for example, dsmc -asnode=CID01744-pi-qs-FIL-00</p> </li> <li> <p>You can check the timestamp of the backup before a given date and time inside dsmc shell q ba -pitt=17:00:00 -pitd=03/13/25 \"/root/yytest/*\"</p> </li> </ul> <p></p> <ul> <li> <p>You can pick which file you would like to restore in dsmc shell: restore /root/yytest/* -pick </p> </li> <li> <p>Or you can restore the directory inside dsmc shell restore /root/yytest/*</p> </li> </ul> <p>Now I got the files I had before back: </p>"},{"location":"#demo-summary","title":"Demo summary","text":"<p>As I have shown, PowerVS and Cobalt Iron Compass Backup-as-a-Service hosted on IBM Cloud address specific concerns you have as recapped below: \u2022   Unique Data retention policy for each of the business units \u2022   Ability to restore on demand in case of loss of data or as needed to support users \u2022   Meet data backup/restore policies unique to each of those departments. \u2022   Meet twice a year DR test requirements to assure your auditors on the business continuity strategy.</p> <p>As a next step, we are excited to work with you to setup a Pilot project to migrate couple of your Power workloads and setup backup policies so you can experience the same in real time to feel confident to begin migration to IBM Cloud.</p>"},{"location":"#do-it-yourself","title":"Do It Yourself","text":"<p>Prerequisites to Secure backup from on-premises to IBM cloud:</p> <p>1.1 Log in to IBM Cloud and provision Secure Automated Backup with Compass from IBM Cloud catalog. 1.2 Set up secure network connection between on-premises to IBM Cloud, via VPN or Direct Link. 1.3 Enroll systems and applications to be protected on Compass Commander UI (\u201cSYSTEMS\u201d tab) and enable the backup. 1.4.
